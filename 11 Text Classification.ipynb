    "## Key Concepts in Text Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Categories or Classes:** Text documents are assigned to predefined categories or classes based on their content. These categories could be binary (e.g., spam/not spam) or multiclass (e.g., topic categories).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Extraction:** Text documents are typically represented as feature vectors, where each feature represents a characteristic of the text (e.g., word frequencies, TF-IDF scores, word embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classifier Model:** A machine learning model is trained to learn the relationship between the input features (text representations) and the target classes. Common classifiers include logistic regression, Naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Data:** Text classification models are trained on labeled datasets, where each document is associated with a known category or class label. The quality and size of the training data significantly impact the performance of the classifier."

    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Preprocess Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenize the text into words or tokens.\n",
    "- Remove stopwords, punctuation, and other noise.\n",
    "- Apply stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Feature Extraction\n",
    "- Represent each document as a feature vector using techniques like Bag-of-Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), or word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Train Classifier Model\n",
    "- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "- Train a classifier model (e.g., logistic regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) using the training data and their corresponding labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Evaluate Model Performance\n",
    "- Evaluate the trained model on the testing data to assess its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score."
